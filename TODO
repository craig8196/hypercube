Using only sends and receives, write the MPI code to implement vector reduce and vector broadcast.
Your algorithm should work for any number of processors and be able to 
reduce the answer to any node or broadcast from any node.

Show that your algorithm works for various numbers of nodes, reduction targets, broadcast origins, and vector sizes.

Determine and graph the average time to perform a reduce and broadcast using your algorithms for vectors of 1 number each to vectors of 65K numbers each.  
When timing, use 3, 6, 9 and 15 independent nodes and reduce to or broadcast from node 5.

Draw conclusions about the graphs and determine the maximum bandwidth of each machine.

Write a 1-2 page report detailing your solution and include a graph of your performance results.
Email the report to <cs484.snell at gmail.com> as a pdf.
